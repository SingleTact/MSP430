# SingleTactMSP430Demo

1. Analogue mode into the MSP430, using an ADC.  Display the output on the LCD.  I.e. V = ###.

2. An MSP430 version using the I2C.  Just F = ### (where F goes from -255 to 768).

3. A simplified Arduino version that resets the baseline, then just reads the sensor and outputs the data over the comm port.  Just F = ### counts.

These are available in thre different folders (as named).
